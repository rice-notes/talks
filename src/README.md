# Talks @ Rice

I'll be putting my notes from the talks I attend at Rice here.  If you'd like
to make edits, contribute your notes, or feel that I'm unfairly characterizing
a talk / your work, please [make an issue on
github](https://github.com/rice-notes/talks/issues/new) and it'll get
addressed!

#### quality

Ideally these would be very high quality summarizations of the wonderful talks
given often at Rice, but it's often difficult to get everything down cleanly
the first time, so you're more than welcome ( and encouraged! ) to suggest
grammatical fixes or content restructuring.
