# Understanding Patterns of Mass Violence w/ Data and Science

## mass violence / oppression

* "post-truth" - institutions considering mass violence always lieing and
  hoping they get away with it
* lies often easily disproven
* human rights campaigns committed to truth, better be a truth
* statistics isn't the center of the argument, but a footnote / backing up claim

## trial of former president of chad, hissene habre

* brought to power by a coup supported by the US / CIA
* was supported because he ran a war campaign against Libya, an enemy of the US
* over the course of the war took several thousand war prisoners
* geneva convention put mandates on how to manage PoW
* HR activists claim that these prison camps were actuall death camps

the data:  
* authorized notarized copies of documents from the chad prisons
* (original documents were recovered from trash piles!)
* high resolution photographs of the documents
* 518 complete reports roughly uniform over 3 years in the middle of the
  president's regime

each report:  
* # of patients at BoD / EoD
* any significant events that happened at the prison
* looking at # of deaths / # of people @ the prison gives crude mortality rate

conclusions:  
* mortality rates 90-540x greater than normal adult male mortality in Chad
* 1.3-4.1x greater than US prisoners in Japanese prisons (WW2)
* 1.3-4.5x greater than German prisoners in Soviet prisons (WW2)

effect on the court:  
* this quantative evidence really aided in the court, since qualitative
  evidence can be very misconstrued
* 

## the tricky bit of missing data

most often the issue with human rights is that we don't know what we don't know

### iraq body count

* rigorous documentation by deaths reported news sources
* looking at the data collection, large correlation between the number of
  sources who reported on an event and the number of deaths in an event
* **which means** that events with only a few killings might not have been
  reported on at all!

does this matter?:  
* small killings
    * made by shi'a militants
    * made with firearms
    * committed for ethnic cleansing
* large killings:
    * AQI (alqeada) / collateral damage
    * airstrikes / bombings
    * goal: destabilizing / territory control

meaning:  we were chiefly focused on the killings made by AQI, but we may have
completely missed where most of the deaths were coming from in Iraq.  In fact,
this ethnic cleansing pushed sunni muslims west and may have contributed to the
rise of ISIS.

## predictive policing

goal:  
* training models on police data to attempt to predict where future crimes 
  will be
* ramp up police presence in those areas

actual:  
* models find patterns in this police data
* police presence is G

## Q/A:

*Did you have any data on the geo-spatial distribution of which drugs were used
in Oakland?*

arrests primarily for meth, heroine, and marijuana, there's definitely a
difference in the distribution, but it doesn't really change our conclusion

*given that predictive policing is so bad, why are we doing it?*

"unholy marriage of selection bias and confirmation bias"
