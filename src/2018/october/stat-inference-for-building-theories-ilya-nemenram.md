# Statistical Inference for Building Theories: The Missing Part of (Bio)Physics

speaker: [ilya nemenran](http://www.physics.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/nemenman-ilya.html)

## what do biophsycists / his group study

* how biology processes info / learns
  * neurons / cells / brains etc...
  * limits to information processing cap.
  * computational / biophysical mech. used to study these environments

* what even matters in biological systems?
  * descriptions of phenomena that preserve relevant features?
  * how to learn equations of motion automatically using machine learning
  * can successfully learn planetary motion, can we learn motions that we 
    don't yet fully understand?
  * would like to model and understand animal actions from data.  we're not as
    smart as newton, need help coming up with equations

## general process of physics

### the new world physics

no. parameters: $k$, no. observations: $m$

classical statistics / physics: $k / m << $
machine learning: $k / m = \mathcal{O}(1)$
modern biophysics / statistics: $k / m >> 1$

## what's the big question?

* building models with a large amount of parameters with minimal data
*

## proteins: residue contact prediction
